## Abstract
How the housing prices are affected by their surrounding environments? Though it's a tough work to figure out all of the related factors. In this study, we mainly focus on the factors of the air quality, metro lines and crimes, and exploit how they influenced the housing prices in New York City (NYC). To do this, we profiled and compiled historical information on changes in housing prices, air quality, metro lines and crimes from 2010 till now in all the boroughs and blocks in NYC.
