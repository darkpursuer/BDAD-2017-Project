## Abstract
How the housing prices are affected by their surrounding environments? Though it's a tough work to figure out all of the related factors. In this study, we mainly focus on the factors of the air quality, metro entrances and crimes, and exploit how they influenced the housing prices in New York City (NYC). To do this, we profiled and compiled historical information on changes in housing prices, air quality, metro entrances and crimes from 2010 till now in all the boroughs and blocks in NYC. With the refined data, we calculated the scores of each factors in each blocks with different measurements, then trained and tested some distinct multiple linear regression models which implied a large and statistically significant association between housing prices and these three factors. (And the result will tell us which factor plays the most important role on the housing prices...)

## Introduction
It's an intersting task to discover the law how the housing prices increased till now. However, it's also a complicated and tough work to figure out all the factors that affect the housing prices. For example, the location of your house, the nearby metro lines and your working place determine how long will you take to reach your destinations, the environment quality and noise environment affect the degree of comfort of your house, and the criminal situations and the locations of nearby police department and fire department influence you sense of security. And, definitely, the most important thing to be considered is the price of your house or apartment. 

In this study, we chose three main factors, air quality, metro entrances and crime, to simulate their relationships with the housing prices. 


## Motivation
Housing prices has been one of the most important things that need to be considered by people in the United States, especially in those megacities like New York City, the Bay Area, etc. As Glaeser (2005) <sup>[1]</sup> mentioned, the housing price has been kept increasing in the past 60 years. And this is always a heavy burden for those new young graduates or poors. Besides the prices of houses, it's also important to consider the housing environments, such as air quality, metro entrances, crime, etc. Thus, to help consumers choosing a favored house with lower price and good environments is urgent. The aim of our study it to build a Big Data application in order to help consumers make wise decisions on where and how to buy their desirable houses.
